# StewieSurvival

a Minecraft server. It’s done.

I have the files now, so I’m putting everything here instead of letting it die on a disk. Anyone can run it, host their own version, edit it, whatever. No main official server anymore.

Just take it and use it.

## Running it

Download the repo and start it like a normal Minecraft server. Change stuff if you want.

## Server list

If you’re running StewieSurvival from these files and want to be listed, open an issue with:

* server name
* IP / domain
* short description (optional)

and I’ll add it.

### List:

(uhh make an issue)
